If you load a log and the spawn doesn't give you access to any checks or other areas, please submit an issue with that location so I can add it in.

If there's any checks / hints missing please also submit those as issues.

to-do:
  
Add CSMC peeking ability.

Add logic so that you can only do checks which are possible for you to actually do with your current item set.
